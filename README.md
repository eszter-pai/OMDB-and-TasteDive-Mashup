# OMDB-and-TasteDive-Mashup
This hands-on project is in the Python 3 Programming Specialization offered by University of Michigan via Coursera. 
Mashing up data from two different APIs to make movie recommendations. 

#### The TasteDive API provides a movie (or bands, TV shows, etc.) as a query input, and returns a set of related items. 
#### The OMDB API provides a movie title as a query input and get back data about the movie, including scores from various review sites (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc.).

use TasteDive to get related movies for a whole list of titles. Combine the resulting lists of related movies, and sort them according to their Rotten Tomatoes scores (which will require making API calls to the OMDB API.)
